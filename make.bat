REM Appending CC_PATH to PATH (instead of prepending) so that Windows keeps using C:\Windows\System32\find.exe instead of %CC_PATH%\find.exe on next runs.
echo ;%PATH%; | find /i /c ";%CC_PATH%;" >nul || set PATH=%PATH%;%CC_PATH%
echo ;%PATH%; | find /i /c ";%SYS_PATH%;" >nul || set PATH=%PATH%;%SYS_PATH%
